# Detect Pixeleted Image and Correct It

## Overview
This project presents a deep learning-based solution for detecting and restoring pixelated images. The model utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to learn the necessary features and patterns from the input data, allowing it to effectively identify and correct pixelated or blurred images.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of the following layers:

1. **Convolutional Layer 1**: 32 filters of size (3, 3) with ReLU activation, input shape (img_width, img_height, 3)
2. **Max Pooling Layer 1**: (2, 2) pooling size
3. **Convolutional Layer 2**: 64 filters of size (3, 3) with ReLU activation
4. **Max Pooling Layer 2**: (2, 2) pooling size
5. **Convolutional Layer 3**: 128 filters of size (3, 3) with ReLU activation
6. **Max Pooling Layer 3**: (2, 2) pooling size
7. **Flatten Layer**
8. **Dense Layer 1**: 128 units with ReLU activation
9. **Dense Layer 2**: 1 unit with sigmoid activation for binary classification

## Training and Evaluation
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function, as the task is a binary classification problem to determine whether an image is pixelated or not.

During the training process, the model learns to map the relationship between pixelated and restored versions of the input images, allowing it to effectively deblur or restore the quality of new, pixelated input images.

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric.

## Usage
To use this model, you can follow these steps:

1. Load the pre-trained model weights.
2. Pass a new, pixelated image through the model.
3. The model will output a binary prediction, indicating whether the image is pixelated or not.
4. If the image is predicted as pixelated, you can use the model to restore the image by applying the learned deblurring or restoration process.

## Conclusion
This deep learning-based model for image restoration and deblurring demonstrates the power of convolutional neural networks in tackling image-related tasks. By leveraging the model's ability to learn relevant features and patterns, it can effectively identify and correct pixelated or blurred images, making it a valuable tool for various applications, such as image enhancement, video processing, and more.
